//TITLE
//DESCRIPTION (in quotes "")
//TYPE (Indiv or Joint)
//PREREQUISITES (D=3 means decision 3 must be made beforehand, N=3 means decision 3 must NOT have been made beforehand, finance=10 means at least 10 finance must be possessed.  a_role (applicant) and r_role (recipient) restrict roles of players (Use "R" "M" and "F").  "none" used for no prereqs.)
//EFFECTS (abbreviations are: explore = exploratory, exploit = exploitative, finance = financial, f_change = ongoing financial
//
//For joint decisions, EFFECTS takes three lines: one for the applicant, recipient, and both.
//If a party is unaffected (, you can placehold the line with finance=0:0
//the special effect 'join' is unique to the joint venture decision, and 'jointgrant' is unique to joint Apply for Grants.
//Please ensure that these two are not encapsulated by probability brackets (ie no P=0.5(jointgrant)) as in the case of jointgrant,
//probability is written within the software.
//
//note that outcome format is: abbreviation=NUMBER:DELAY and are separated by a space.
//an outcome can be linked with a bonus for related players (like a FB who financed another player) with a double equals like so: 
//finance==1:0
//Linked outcomes incur the same effect on whatever FB financed said player.  
//
//For probabilities, use P=probability_magnitude(effect=magnitude:delay effect2=magnitude2:delay) and so on.
//For example,
//P=0.5(finance=1:0 exploit=1:0 explore=1:0)
